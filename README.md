# Robo-Ranger

* This game was made during a 48 hour game jam at Iowa State University.
* The Goal of the game is to last as long as possible while traveling as far as possible.
* Move your robot to the right and collect coins to increase your score and time.
* You lose if you fall for too long, or your time runs out.

## Major Challenges
* The level is theoretically inifite, so if you were to travel without running out of time the game would probably crash instead of reaching an end to the level.
* Player loss was a challenge due to keeping track of falling time and the timer.
* Interaction with coins.
